What is Pyplan?
===================
Pyplan is a platform for creating and sharing **planning and data analytics apps.**

========================================
What is a planning or data analytic App?
========================================
An app is a software development intended for supporting a quantitative decision-making process.
It basically contains three main elements: data ingestion, data processing and projection and interactive output interfaces.

===============================================================
What is the difference between a planning and an analytic app?
===============================================================
A planning app is a calculation process according to know and defined business rules.
In an analytic app instead, business rules are unknown and they are inferred based on historical data through statistical or machine learning mechanisms.

=====================================
What are Pyplan main characteristics?
=====================================
.. Lists
* No Code/Low Code development environment
* Code is contained on a hierarchical organized influence diagram of nodes
* Code running is orchestrated and optimized automatically
* Interfaces are created by a drag and drop user interface
* Different type of users and roles are supported
* Automatically scale infrastructure

When do you need Pyplan
=======
When do you have a **planning process supported in Excel** that became so complex that most of the time is wasted checking and validating numbers.

When your **legacy planning system is not flexible enough** to support the variances of your business. Or modifying it takes a lot of effort and time.

When you have **several platforms** for supporting Business Intelligence, Data Analytics and Business Planning and want to integrate all the quantitative analysis in a single place for supporting decision making.

When you want to **reduce the licensing cost** of Business Intelligence, Data Analytics and Business Planning.

When you want your team to embrace the **lingua franca of Data Science â€“ Python.**

When you want to be at the **cutting edge of Data Science community discoveries.**

Why Pyplan instead of Jupyter Notebooks or Visual Studio?
=======
Jupyter Notebooks are an excellent tool for exploratory analysis. It original goal was the creation of interactive scientific papers that blend explanatory text with executable code. It was not designed for creating productive applications so that serious software development issues arise when used for this purpose.

Visual Studio (like others IDE) are serious software development environments. Its users are software engineers that creates apps. It is not intended to be used by people that do not know how to code and want to explore results of the middle process and create new analysis and user interfaces on the fly.

Pyplan sits in between of Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio. It is a specific purpose (Data Analytics and Planning) development environment meant to be used by Business Analysts.
