3.1	Introduction
What you will find in this User Guide: This guide provides an explanation of the Pyplan development environment. It is not intended as a guide to learn Python, neither other libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Xarray or Plotly that are natively included in Pyplan. 
It has been structured in the following sections:
3.2	Pyplan App Homepage
Where the application’s main menu and tools are described.
Pyplan Apps are made of different type of assets: code modules, input forms, user interfaces among others.
Homepage provides access to application manager, file manager, and several administrative tools that are shown to users with appropriate privileges
3.3	Application manager
Allows creating or opening an existing app. You can choose between creating an app from scratch starting from some boilerplate examples or opening and existing app.

3.4	File manager
Apps are made of different type of assets (files): Code modules, Interfaces, Forms, Databases among others.
The File manager provides assistance for working with files - uploading, moving, copying and downloading- related to your applications.

3.5	Code
Pyplan organizes Python code in nodes that are represented as a workflow (influence diagram.) In this section, all the tools and features created for helping you build the calculation and data manipulation logic are explained.
Nodes definition end with a result that is the object computed as output of that node. Nodes can be evaluated, and their result can be displayed as a table, graph or map. All native Pyplan visualization alternatives and parameter configurations are described in this section. 
3.6	Interface Designer
Visualization and user controls are grouped in interfaces which allow the user to interact with your app and explore the results. In this chapter, we will explain how to create, configure, and share these apps. Most importantly: no coding required!
